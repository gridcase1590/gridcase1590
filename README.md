! For example: The r/ARG community takes consent away from the artist in a similar way as performative empathy, it promotes the artist's work as an ARG even though it's not and if the artist disagrees he is often insulted with terms such as "asshole, larper and schizo". - This is because in such "libertarian communities" individualism is considered as a danger.
