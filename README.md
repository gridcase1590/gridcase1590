# Who am I?

```diff
> I, for the past 6 years have been known as V3RDAD.
> I, am a radical artist that opposes alternative relaity gaming.
> I, will never stop making real art for which my github account was bruteforced into.
> (Github Mobile's 2FA was not rate limited at the time of writing.)
> I, really wanted to distinguish myself from everyone after this attack, seeing how even 1% of my personality makes people jealous.
> I've decided that I might as well indulge in the expression of my full self and give it my all this time, rather then to try and hide it even more.
> And so, I've purchased two GRiD computers to truly nail my name into history this time and perhaps into the face of those, who always fealt threatened that I would outshine them too fast.
> Now, I finally feel this great feeling, this freedom to start expressing myself once more.

> Truth for me is a scalar and not a binary, this allows me to see the world in it's true colors.
> It also saves time to just call Fibs 'half truths' without having to explain actualities.

> The reason for which my art and I are labeled radical is most likely because my focus is more about bringing fiction into reality,
> rather then labeling everything black and white. I argue it helps people to see more possibilities that way and this creates a better learning experience.

! I oppose r/ARG is because they take away consent from the artist in a similar way as performative empathy,
! they promote the artist's work as an alternative reality game even though it is not and if the artist disagrees
! then he is often insulted "shizo" or targeted/hacked just like how I was.
! I really just guess but this might be because in such communities individualism is considered as a danger to collectivism.

> I am into individualist (self-discovered) philosophy, military hardware, and the deep web for it's more vibrant, interesting sites as opposed to the surface web.
