@@ Who am I? @@
> I, for the past 6 years have been known as V3RDAD.
> I, am a radical artist that opposes alternative relaity gaming.
> I, will never stop creating real art for which my github account was bruteforced into.
> PS: (Github Mobile's 2FA was not rate limited at the time of writing).
> The reason for which my art and I are called radical is because my focus is more about bringing fiction into reality,
> as opposed to labeling everything "real", "not real". I suppose this is because it helps people to see more possibilities
> and creates a learning experience rather then trying to correct everything.
> Truth for me is a scalar and not a binary, this allows me to see the world in it's true colors.
> It also saves time to just call Fibs 'half truths' and not having to explain actualities with multiple sentences.
> This is why I dislike dualism and r/ARG the most, since they inflict their personal opinions onto others by certain tactics
! For example: The r/ARG community takes consent away from the artist in a similar way as performative empathy,
! it promotes the artist's work as an alternative reality game even though it's not and if the artist disagrees
! he is often insulted or targeted just like how I was.
! This is because in such communities individualism is considered as a danger to collectivism.
