## Who am I?
```diff
> I, for the past 6 years have been known as V3RDAD.
> I, am a radical artist that opposes alternative relaity gaming.
> I, will never stop being creative for which my github account was bruteforced into.
> (Github Mobile's 2FA was not rate limited at the time of writing.)

> The reason for which my art and I are labeled radical is most likely because
> my focus is more about bringing fiction into reality,
> rather then labeling everything black and white.
> I argue it helps people to see more possibilities that way
> and creates a better learning experience rather then correcting them.

> Truth for me is a scalar and not a binary, this allows me to see the world in it's true colors.
> It also saves time to just call Fibs 'half truths' without having to explain actualities.

! I oppose r/ARG is because they take away consent from the artist in a similar way as performative empathy,
! they promote the artist's work as an alternative reality game even though it is not and if the artist disagrees
! then he is often insulted "shizo" or targeted/hacked just like how I was.
! I really just guess but this might be because in such communities individualism is considered as a danger to collectivism.

> I will be adding more things here in the future.
